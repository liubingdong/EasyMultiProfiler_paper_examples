# Description
This repository hosts code scripts and example data to support the supplementary materials of the paper.

The code provided here is primarily intended for demonstrating the examples presented in the paper. Due to the large size of the datasets and the substantial computational time required for the workflows (**approximately 3â€“7 minutes per example on Apple M1 Pro**), these examples are not recommended for new users to learn the package. Instead, we have prepared detailed small-scale dataset for testing, available in the [online tutorial](http://easymultiprofiler.xielab.net/).
